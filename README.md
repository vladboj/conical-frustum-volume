# Elliptical Frustum Toolkit

This project provides a set of tools for working with elliptical frustums, particularly focusing on computations related to their dimensions and volumes. The user can interactively choose between various functionalities:

- Height Computation: Given the desired volume, calculates the corresponding height of the frustum.

- Volume Computation: Computes the volume of the elliptical frustum based on provided dimensions.

- New Volume Computation: Allows for computing the volume of a subcontainer by specifying a new height.

- Solute Volume Computation: Computes the volume of solute required to achieve a desired solution concentration, given the solvent's volume.

Users can input their desired parameters and interactively select the operation they want to perform. The project is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy adaptation to different elliptical frustum dimensions.

Additionally, the project includes predefined dimensions for two specific containers, enabling quick calculations for these cases.

## Usage

To use the Volume to Height Converter:

- Clone the repository.
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Double click the "elliptical_frustum_toolkit" shortcut.
- Follow the prompts.

Personally, I also added the shortcut to a folder indexed by windows search for quicker access.
