# Conical-Frustum Height Calculator

**The Elliptical Frustum Height Calculator is a Python-based tool designed to determine the height of containers shaped like elliptical frustums. By inputting parameters such as major and minor radii of the top and bottom ellipses, along with the desired volume, the calculator computes the height of the frustum efficiently.**

## Usage

To use the Volume to Height Converter:

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Run the main.py script.
- Follow the prompts to input the object's dimensions and the desired volume.
- The script will calculate and display the height corresponding to the specified volume.
