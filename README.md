## About ##

The idea of building this project arose from a real life need of working with elliptical frustum shaped containers such as basins and glasses, while also seeming like a fun learning opportunity.

## What you can do ##

- Height Computation: Given the desired volume, calculates the corresponding height of the frustum

- Volume Computation: Computes the volume of the elliptical frustum based on provided dimensions

- New Volume Computation: Allows for computing the volume of a subcontainer by specifying a new height

- Solute Volume Computation: Computes the volume of solute required to achieve a desired solution concentration, given the solvent's volume

## Usage ##

- Clone the repository
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system
- Double click the `run_script.bat` file
- Follow the prompts

Additionally, I also created a shortcut to the `run_script.bat` file and added it to a folder indexed by windows search for quicker access.
